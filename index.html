    <h3>This website is more of an exercise than anything.</h3>
    <p>Right now, we're going to learn about lists.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is an "undordered list"</li>
      <li>You can tell because there are no numbers.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>And also because of this forward-tabbed little guy over here.</li>
          <li>This one too, and we're using the "\UL" to create the second tier of lists - right above the last line, and a tab to the left.</li>
          <li>Each sentence is wrapped with a "\LI" too.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>H3ere's a quick way to remember these codes:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="hobbies.html">If you're looking for an ordered list</a> (<em>a list with numbers</em>), then you're looking for the ol' "\OL"</li>
      <li>But if you're trying to get around an unordered part of town (dots), you need the ULtimate command of "\UL"</li>
      <li>And of course, there's Bruce Li. Always remember: If you're making a point, make it with "\LI"</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><em>"But what about if I'm writing my dissertation?"</em></h2>
    <p>Well, you're in luck today, kid.</p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>There's no better way to lipstick a pig than with Roman Numerals.</li>
      <li>It's like we're back in 2nd grade. Okay, here's the thing: it's just an i.</li>
      <li>Seriously. Just type "type=\i" with proper formatting into the ol' "\OL" and you're as golden as that switchblade wielding human-boy horse creature.</li>
